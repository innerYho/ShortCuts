w = jump the cursor to the next world or Object

w + number : move the cursor n[number] after the initial potition

    d + b = delete all the content before the cursor in the line

    eg: const {ayuda} = require('./helper.js')

ctrl + o : go back to the file index 
    the cursor in the module that is exported
        eg: module.exports.ayuda = () => {
